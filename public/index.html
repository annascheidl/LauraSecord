    <h1>Walk in the Woods</h1>
    <div>
      <span>Walk in the Woods is based on Laura Secord's walk through the woods to get to the British troops to warn them in time about an American invasion.
        With that information they were able to decimate the American troops and send them packing.
        The idea of the game is that the player in Laura Secord's role will try to reach the camp.
        The camp, in this case, is a cabin of which Laura must go into in order to click the sphere. Once you click the sphere Laura is safe!
        The environment has multiple sorts of terrain-related traps to slow the player down.
        A second player, the soldier, is hunting Laura Secord and must capture Laura by clicking on her.
